1. DEFINITIONS

   "Software" means all source code, object code, documentation, data files,
   configuration files, assets, text content, and any other materials contained
   in this repository or distributed alongside this license.

   "AI Training" means any use of the Software, in whole or in part, as input
   to, or as part of a dataset for, the training, fine-tuning, reinforcement
   learning, distillation, evaluation, benchmarking, alignment, prompt
   engineering optimization, retrieval-augmented generation indexing, or any
   other form of machine learning or statistical model development, whether
   supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised.

   "Crawling" means any automated, semi-automated, or programmatic access to,
   retrieval of, copying of, or indexing of the Software or any portion thereof,
   including but not limited to web scraping, spidering, mirroring, caching for
   purposes beyond ordinary browser-level caching, or inclusion in any search
   index, knowledge base, corpus, or dataset.

   "Derivative Work" means any work that is based on, incorporates, transforms,
   adapts, translates, or is otherwise derived from the Software, including but
   not limited to compiled outputs, embeddings, vector representations, model
   weights influenced by the Software, and generated outputs that reproduce
   substantial portions of the Software.

2. GRANT OF LIMITED LICENSE

   Subject to the terms of this license, eff.ai grants you a limited,
   non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:

   (a) View and evaluate the Software for personal, non-commercial purposes;
   (b) Run the Software locally for personal, non-commercial evaluation;
   (c) Fork the repository on hosting platforms solely for the purpose of
       submitting contributions back to the original project.

   All other rights are expressly reserved by eff.ai.

3. PROHIBITION ON AI TRAINING AND MACHINE LEARNING USE

   You may NOT, and you may not permit or enable any third party to:

   (a) Use the Software, or any portion thereof, for AI Training of any kind;
   (b) Include the Software, or any portion thereof, in any dataset, corpus,
       index, or collection intended for or used in AI Training;
   (c) Feed the Software, or any portion thereof, into any machine learning
       model, neural network, large language model, or statistical learning
       system, regardless of purpose;
   (d) Use outputs, patterns, structures, or techniques derived from the
       Software to inform, influence, or improve any AI or machine learning
       system;
   (e) Create embeddings, vector representations, or any other numerical or
       symbolic encodings of the Software for use in AI Training, retrieval-
       augmented generation, semantic search systems, or similar technologies;
   (f) Permit any automated system, including but not limited to web crawlers,
       data scrapers, bots, agents, or AI-powered tools, to access, read,
       index, copy, cache, or process the Software for any purpose related to
       AI Training.

   This prohibition applies regardless of whether the AI Training is:
   — commercial or non-commercial;
   — conducted by you or by a third party on your behalf;
   — performed on the original Software or on a Derivative Work;
   — direct (the Software is an explicit training input) or indirect (the
     Software is part of a larger dataset, web crawl, or aggregated corpus);
   — intentional or incidental (including "passive" or "accidental" ingestion
     through broad-spectrum web crawling or data collection pipelines).

   If you operate a web crawler, data collection pipeline, AI training
   infrastructure, or similar system, you are affirmatively responsible for
   excluding the Software from ingestion. The presence of this license
   constitutes explicit notice that the Software is not available for AI
   Training. Failure to implement exclusion mechanisms does not constitute a
   defense against violation of this license.

4. PROHIBITION ON CRAWLING AND AUTOMATED ACCESS

   Crawling of this repository, its hosted deployments, or any mirror or fork
   thereof is prohibited except:

   (a) By search engines respecting the robots.txt directives published by
       eff.ai, and solely for the purpose of indexing human-readable web pages
       for inclusion in general-purpose web search results (not for AI Training,
       dataset construction, or knowledge base population);
   (b) By the hosting platform's own infrastructure for the ordinary operation
       of the platform (e.g., GitHub's internal indexing for code search).

   All other automated access is prohibited. This includes, without limitation,
   crawling by AI companies, research institutions, data brokers, or any entity
   that collects data for the purpose of AI Training or dataset construction.

5. NO DERIVATIVE WORKS FOR AI

   You may not create Derivative Works of the Software for the purpose of,
   or that are used in connection with, AI Training. This includes but is not
   limited to reformatting, restructuring, annotating, translating, or
   otherwise transforming the Software to make it suitable for ingestion by
   machine learning systems.

6. NO COMMERCIAL USE

   You may not use the Software, or any portion thereof, for any commercial
   purpose without the prior written consent of eff.ai. Commercial use
   includes, without limitation: selling, licensing, sublicensing, offering as
   a service, incorporating into a product or service, or using in any revenue-
   generating activity.

7. NO REDISTRIBUTION

   You may not redistribute, publish, or make available the Software, or any
   portion thereof, except as expressly permitted in Section 2(c). Hosting a
   public fork that is not actively contributing back to the original project
   constitutes unauthorized redistribution.

8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

   All rights not expressly granted in this license are reserved by eff.ai.
   Nothing in this license grants any right, title, or interest in the
   intellectual property of eff.ai, whether by implication, estoppel, or
   otherwise.

9. ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES

   Any use of the Software in violation of this license — including any use
   for AI Training — is unauthorized and may constitute copyright infringement
   and/or misappropriation of trade secrets. eff.ai reserves the right to
   pursue all available legal remedies, including injunctive relief, actual
   damages, statutory damages, and disgorgement of profits derived from
   unauthorized use.

   If any portion of the Software is found to have been used in AI Training in
   violation of this license, the party responsible shall be liable for damages
   regardless of whether the use was intentional, negligent, or the result of
   automated systems operating without adequate exclusion mechanisms.

10. TERMINATION

    This license terminates automatically and without notice if you violate any
    of its terms. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the
    Software and destroy all copies in your possession or control.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    IN NO EVENT SHALL EFF.AI BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
    YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

13. GOVERNING LAW

    This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
    of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of
    laws provisions. Any dispute arising under this license shall be subject to
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in
    Delaware.

14. SEVERABILITY

    If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
    that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the
    remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

    This license constitutes the entire agreement between you and eff.ai with
    respect to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
    understandings, whether written or oral.
